This group of programs are all different approaches to sorting a list of 4 numbers.

builtinSort.py is built around using the native sort() function

flexibleBuiltInSort.py uses the same built in sort() function but allows for the input of as many numbers as the user wants.

customSort.py is a custom sort function that iterates through a list of numbers.

customSortTested.py is customSort.py but with test cases added for the fun of it.
